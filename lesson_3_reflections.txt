When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Forks
are for other people's repos. Clones move repos from github to my local machine. Branches exist within a single repo.
