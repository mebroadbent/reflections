Looking at the files manually requires that every line be examined.
 Diff allows a user to only examine the lines that have differences. 
 This can be a large time savings, especially in contexts where a small
  fraction of the lines have been changed.

  Having the entire history of a file available would be helpful when trying to fix errors, 
  because a user could compare past versions to the current version to find out when
  the error was introduced.

  The advantage of manually choosing commit points is that each commit represents something 
  easily describable and understandable. This means that it your sequence of commits is
  essentially the workflow of the project.

  Updating multiple files together is useful when they contain code that relates to 
  one another. it is not useful when each file is used separately, as in Google Dogs.

  Git log and git diff allow you to see the sequence of commits, along with examining 
  how many lines and files have changed between each pair of commits.

  Having the ability to roll back changes allows a user to be more aggressive in making 
  potentially application-breaking changes, because it is simple to undo them.

  Git will be useful at work as well as in personal projects.
