What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

Initializing a repository creates the .git folder that will keep track of changes to files in the folder where
the repository was initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
The staging area is different from the working directory because it only contains the files that are part of the next commit. This allows you to separate out the files that have changed in each commit.
